        The usual way that applicants introduce themselves to a potential employer is to submit a résumé. An obvious
        drawback of this information source is that applicants control the content of the information as well as the way
        it is presented. This type of information is therefore biased in favor of the applicant and (although this is
        unethical) may not even be accurate.

        However, résumés are an inexpensive way to gather information and provide
        employers with a starting point. Organizations typically use résumés as a basis for deciding which candidates to
        investigate further.As with employment applications, an HR staff member reviews the résumés to identify
        candidates meeting such basic requirements as educational background, related work performed, and types of
        equipment the person has used. Because résumés are created by the job applicants (or the applicants have at
        least approved résumés created by someone they hire), they also may provide some insight into how candidates
        communicate and present themselves.

        Employers tend to decide against applicants whose résumés are unclear,
        sloppy, or full of mistakes. On the positive side, résumés may enable applicants to highlight accomplishments
        that might not show up in the format of an employment application. Review of résumés is most valid when the
        content of the résumés is evaluated in terms of the elements of a job description
